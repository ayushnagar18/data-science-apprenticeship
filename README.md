I'm starting my Data Science journey today on Github and lets see what comes in next in 90 days.

# Why Shape Inspection is critical?
Shape inspection is critical before modeling because it ensures that the foundational data used for creating a model is accurate, complete, and reliable. This proactive step helps avoid costly errors, delays, and reworks in later stages of a project.

# Why class imbalance breaks naïve accuracy metrics?
Class imbalance "breaks" or misleads naïve accuracy metrics because a model can achieve a high overall accuracy score by simply predicting the majority class for all instances, while completely failing to identify the minority class.

# What normalization changes mathematically?
normalization mathematically transforms the values of a feature column to a common scale without distorting the original data distribution's shape.
